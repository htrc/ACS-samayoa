# Topics over time

The JupyterLab nodebooks in this folder were used for:
- `topics_info.ipynb`: extracting information about each
topic in the topic model (such as the top 20 words in the topic by weight, as well as
the top 1000 and bottom 100 documents most/least representative of each topic)
- `topics_over_time.ipynb`: generate the evolution of topics over time (where time was represented
by the publication date associated with each page)
